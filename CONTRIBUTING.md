# How to contribute to the CO2ken project

Currently the project is in very early stages, and therefore in flux
prior to mainnet launch, so we're only inviting contributions in
select areas mostly outside the core.

Here is [a preliminary list of issues for which help would be
welcome](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ACO2ken+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

## Issue tracking

Any kind of feedback is very welcome; please first check that your bug
/ issue / enhancement request is not already [listed
here](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ACO2ken+is%3Aopen), and if not
then file a new issue.

## Helping with development

Any [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
